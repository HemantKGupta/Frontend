Positioning

Relative:
If you relatively position an element, it will stay exactly where it is.You can then shift the element “relative” to its starting point
by setting a vertical or horizontal position.

Absolute:
An absolutely positioned element is positioned in relation to its nearest positioned ancestor.
If the element has no positioned ancestors, it will be positioned in relation to the initial containing block.
Depending on the user agent, this will either be the canvas or the HTML element.

Fixed:
Fixed positioning is a subcategory of absolute positioning.
The difference is that a fixed element’s containing block is the viewport.

Floating:
A floated box can either be shifted to the left or the right until
its outer edge touches the edge of its containing box, or another floated box.
